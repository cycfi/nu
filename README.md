The Nu Series Modular Active Pickups are hacker friendly, general purpose pickups 
that can be used in a variety of applications. These are active multichannel 
pickups with low impedance coils and integrated single-ended, low-power, 
low-noise preamplifier for each coil. The Neodymium-core pickups are low profile 
and modular. They can be used individually or in groups.

This is the next evolutionary stage of our flagship multichannel Neo pickup. The 
Nu sports better crosstalk performance using permalloy ring shields and even 
lower noise with improved discrete preamp design. Most importantly, they sound 
just as good as the original. Same coil, same magnetic structure.

The pickups are designed for polyphonic effects processing —one for each string 
(distortion, EQ, compressor, delay, pan, pitch-shift, etc). Such extensive 
processing is now very possible due to advances in digital signal processing and 
multi-channel audio interfaces and multi-track audio software becoming commonplace.

The modular pickups are not just for guitars. Nus can also be utilized for other 
musical instruments such as the bass guitar, harps, pianos, xylophones, etc. The 
Nus are perfect for fanned-fret electric guitars with the pickup poles positioned 
at various angles.
